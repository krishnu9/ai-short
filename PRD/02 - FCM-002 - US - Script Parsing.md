# User Story: Automatic Script-to-Scene Parsing

**As a:** Content Creator,
**I want:** the system to automatically interpret key phrases or keywords within my pasted script as distinct scenes,
**So that:** I can create a dynamically paced video based on important concepts rather than just sentence breaks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GIVEN a user pastes a script into the text area,
- [ ] AND the script contains content that can be split into scenes based on keywords or key phrases,
- [ ] WHEN the user clicks the "Generate" button,
- [ ] THEN the backend must process the script and return a structured list of scenes, one for each identified keyword or key phrase.
- [ ] AND the frontend must correctly receive and store this list of scenes.

## Engineering Tasks

### Backend Tasks

- `[ ]` **Task: FCM-020 - Create Script Parsing Endpoint**
    - **Description:** Design and implement a new API endpoint, e.g., `POST /api/v1/script/parse`.
    - **Input:** `{ "script": "This is the first sentence. This is the second!" }`
    - **Output:** A JSON object containing a list of scene objects.

- `[ ]` **Task: FCM-021 - Implement Keyword-Based Scene Splitting Logic**
    - **Description:** Develop a robust function to parse the input script string and identify key phrases or keywords that will serve as scene breaks. This will involve more advanced NLP techniques than simple punctuation splitting.
    - **Considerations:** Define criteria for keyword/phrase identification and how scenes are delineated by them.

- `[ ]` **Task: FCM-022 - Define and Return Scene Structure**
    - **Description:** For each identified keyword/phrase, create a structured JSON object representing a scene. The initial structure should be ` { "sceneId": 1, "text": "Relevant text for scene 1 based on keyword." }`.
    - **Output Structure:** The final endpoint response should be an array of these objects: ` { "scenes": [ { "sceneId": 1, ... }, { "sceneId": 2, ... } ] }`

### Frontend Tasks

- `[ ]` **Task: FCM-023 - Create Script Input Component**
    - **Description:** Develop a UI component with a large, user-friendly `<textarea>` for users to paste their script.
    - **Elements:** Include a clear label and a primary "Create My Video" button.

- `[ ]` **Task: FCM-024 - Implement API Service for Script Submission**
    - **Description:** Create a service or function responsible for sending the script content from the text area to the `POST /api/v1/script/parse` backend endpoint.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for API call failures (e.g., network issues, server errors).

- `[ ]` **Task: FCM-025 - Manage Scene Data in State**
    - **Description:** Upon a successful API response, store the returned array of scene objects in the application's state management solution (e.g., React Context, Redux, Zustand).
    - **Verification:** For initial development, log the received scene data to the console to confirm it is being received and stored correctly.
